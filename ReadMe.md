# Avalonia.Controls.Extras

Reusable Avalonia controls with no dependency on Tripous.

The first control is `GroupGrid`, a general-purpose grid for data-entry and business applications. It is designed as a clean Avalonia control that can later be adapted by external frameworks, but the library itself remains framework-neutral.

## GroupGrid Features

Current implemented or planned feature map for `GroupGrid`.

### Architecture

- Avalonia `Control` with custom rendering.
- Separate non-visual `GroupGridEngine`.
- Framework-neutral core, with no Tripous dependency.
- Adapter-based data access through `IGroupGridDataAdapter`.
- Convenience `ItemsSource` support for POCO/list sources.
- `ItemsSource` support for `DataTable` and `DataView`; assigning a `DataTable` uses its `DefaultView`.
- Optional auto-generation of columns from public POCO properties.
- Optional auto-generation of columns from `DataView` data columns.

### Columns

- Base `GroupGridColumn` descriptor.
- Specialized column types:
  - `GroupGridTextColumn`
  - `GroupGridNumberColumn`
  - `GroupGridDateColumn`
  - `GroupGridCheckBoxColumn`
  - `GroupGridLookupColumn`
- Column width and minimum width.
- Column visibility.
- Column display formatting.
- Date column edit formatting through `EditFormat`.
- Column horizontal text alignment.
- Lookup columns support separate `DisplayMember` and `ValueMember`.
- User flags for resize, reorder, grouping, and hiding.
- Query methods for all, visible ordered, hidden, and grouped columns.

### Layout

- Toolbar band.
- Group panel.
- Column header band.
- Filter row band.
- Virtual body viewport.
- Footer total summary band.
- Vertical scrollbar.
- Horizontal scrollbar.
- Visibility properties for toolbar, group panel, column headers, filter panel, and totals summary bands.

### Grouping

- Always root-node based projection.
- Group columns kept as an ordered list of column references.
- Group header rows.
- Group summary rows.
- Expand/collapse per group node.
- Collapsed groups show summary values in the group header.
- Header drag to group panel groups a column.
- Header drag outside the grid hides the column.
- Group panel drag supports grouped-column reorder.
- Grouped-column drag back to header band ungroups and inserts in column order.
- Grouped-column drag outside the grid removes it from grouping.

### Rows And Summaries

- Data rows.
- Group header rows.
- Group summary rows.
- Footer total summary row.
- Summary context menu for group and total summary aggregate selection.
- Summary aggregate kinds:
  - Count
  - Sum
  - Min
  - Max
  - Average

### Interaction

- Single current cell.
- Single selected cell/row.
- Keyboard navigation.
- Mouse selection.
- Group expand/collapse by mouse.
- Column resize by dragging header edge.
- Column reorder by dragging headers.
- Floating header ghost while dragging columns.
- Drop insertion guide for column drag/drop.
- Column header context menu.
- Optional column manager context menu item.
- Default column manager dialog when no `ColumnManagerRequested` handler is attached.
- `GroupGridColumnManagerDialog` is a separate window that edits a serializable `GroupGridSettings` object.
- `GroupGridSettings` includes a settings name and per-column order, visibility, grouping, filter, and summary settings.
- Vertical and horizontal scroll thumb dragging.
- Scrollbar track page scrolling.
- Checkbox/boolean cell toggle by mouse click and `Space`.

### Toolbar

- Compact toolbar buttons rendered in the toolbar band.
- Built-in `Insert` and `Delete` buttons are visible by default.
- Built-in `Edit` button exists but is hidden by default.
- Insert creates an empty row after the current row when the source supports insertion.
- Delete removes the current row through cancellable row-operation events.
- The built-in delete button shows a small default confirmation dialog only when no `DeletingRow` handler is attached.
- Edit raises an event for the application to handle.
- Custom toolbar buttons can be added to the left group or aligned at the far right.
- Toolbar buttons support tooltip text.
- Toolbar API includes add and insert-before/insert-after helpers.

### Sorting And Filtering

- Engine-owned single-column sorting.
- Sorting cycles through none, ascending, descending, and back to none.
- Sort glyph displayed at the right edge of the sorted column header.
- Engine-owned per-column filter state.
- Filter row cells accept typed filter text.
- Filter text is applied when `Enter` is pressed.
- Plain filter text performs contains matching.
- Comparison filter operators:
  - `>`
  - `>=`
  - `<`
  - `<=`
  - `=`
  - `<>`
  - `!=`
- Wildcard filter matching with `%` or `*`.
- `Backspace` edits active filter text.
- `Delete` clears the active column filter.
- `Enter` applies active filter text.
- `Escape` cancels filter editing.
- Column context menu can clear a column filter or all filters.

### Editing

- Edit state tracking.
- Begin edit.
- Commit edit.
- Cancel edit.
- In-place editor host with typed editor controls.
- Text in-place editor.
- Numeric in-place editor with right alignment and numeric validation.
- Numeric edits commit valid numbers and cancel invalid text back to the previous value.
- Date in-place editor with text input, `EditFormat`, and calendar drop-down.
- Date text normalization supports partial input such as day-only and day-month values.
- Lookup in-place editor with custom scrollable drop-down list.
- Boolean cells toggle directly by mouse click or `Space`.
- Custom in-place editors can be supplied through the grid-level `CreateInplaceEditor` event.
- Date normalization can be customized through the grid-level `DateNormalize` event.
- Inline editing uses `Enter` and `Tab` to commit and `Escape` to cancel.
- Validation and commit events.

### Hit Testing

- Hit testing returns band/kind information.
- Cell hit results include direct `GroupGridColumn` references.
- Hit testing supports body cells, group expanders, headers, resize handles, group panel, footer summary, and scroll-aware coordinates.
